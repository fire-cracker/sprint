This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setting up the Application

- $ git clone `git@github.com:fire-cracker/sprint.git`
- $ cd sprint
- $ yarn install , to install dependencies
- $ yarn start, to start the application
Once the app starts-up, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Setting up the Server
- Refer to https://github.com/Archimydes/coding-challenge-mock-api

## Known issues
Everything works as expected; However:
- The payload from the Endpoint does not contain `status` hence the status of the stories can not be displayed
- There are no endpoints for Admin to `Accept` and `Reject` stories
